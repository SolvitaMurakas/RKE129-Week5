                <p>
                    Once upon a time, there was a Jiggllypuff, a Jigglypuff named Peaches that was taken into a sweet comforting home and lifestyle from the streets. That's me, I'm the Jigglypuff. While I've been getting used to my new surroundings and life, I've been introduced to greatest edible thing known to exist! Of course you might be thinking, Peaches, and you would be partially correct, Peaches are my second favourite. Correct answer is, CHOCOLATE! And Chocolate muffins are a heaven on earth and this website is dedicated to storing many different and amazing chocolate muffin recipes.

                <p>
                    Eating just muffins will make your mouth dry, so enjoy an extra list consising of different chocolate flavoured teas! I was also surprised and absolutely delighted to find out chocolate teas exist. Try adding honey and milk, or just condenced milk to the tea, your tastebuds WILL thank you. Pair the excellent tea with muffins, and you will get addicted like it's drugs. Of course you can also pair chocolate muffins with other chocolate flavoured drinks like hot cocoa or mocha coffee.

                    That's right, I'm not alone working on this magnificent list. I have a small, but really great and helpful team. Without them, small Jigglypuff like me would've been fast burnt out. There's only this much muffin recipes and teas to list down before I loose my mind. So thank you to my amazing team!
